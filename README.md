# Marvel Snap Player Stats
## What is it?
### A Python script that reads data from the game files stored in your device and compiles it into a nice webpage. 
### Data shown includes account history, collection, ranked, conquest and card statistics.
&nbsp;
## How does it work?
### This script only reads data from the game files stored in your device. These files are visible to anyone and all the data is easily accessible with a simple file explorer tool.
### This is just a compiler to speed up the process so you don't have to search everything manually.
### The script does not export the data or edit it in any way. Everything is executed locally on your device.
### Note: You will need Python installed on your PC or an app that can run Python on your mobile.
&nbsp;
## How to use it?
### PC: To execute the script just download the project files to your PC and execute file "generate_file.py". This will create a file called stats.html in the same folder and open it automatically on a browser.
### Android: Download the project files to your device (if you are browsing on android make sure to select "Desktop Site" so you see the green download button) and then use an app (tested on Pydroid3) that let's you execute a Python file and execute file "generate_file.py". This will create a file called stats.html in the same folder that you need to open manually on a browser.
### iPhone: Not available at this time. Currently working on making it possible.
